# Project: Parallax and Particles.js


Let’s take our front end design skills to the next level!


There are a ton of really cool and interesting jQuery plugins that add functionality to your websites. The parallax effect is something that’s been used in a lot of news websites.


We’re also going to use particles.js to create a cool animation effect: https://github.com/marcbruederlin/particles.js


Check out the site for parallax.js: http://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/


Your task is to create a single page site that implements both of these plugins. Read the documentation and familiarize how to use them. Use bootstrap for styling alignment of the text, and font awesome for the icons.
